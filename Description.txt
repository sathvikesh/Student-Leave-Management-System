STUDENT LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is the leave management system for the students. The project was worked on PHP. This project has two basic parts, one - the student side and he other - the admin side. From the student side, a student account can be active or inactive depending on admin permission. An active student can apply for a leave under various leave types, check his leave history and other additional things like changing password, details etc. From the admin side, the admin has control over everything. For applying a leave, a student needs to provide details of leave type, from-to dates and description of his leave. In this way he can apply for a leave and wait for the admin's approval.

The admin has a dashboard where he can see all the recent leave applications. If a student has freshly applied for a leave, then a notification pops up. The admin can either approve or disapprove a leave. The admin can write a description intimating the student of any action. The admin can control the students' database by adding or deleting student entries from the database and making them active or inactive. The admin can add different departments in the college, various leave types and all for better segregation. Te admin can manage different leaves; approved, pending and not approved leaves. The admin too can change his password and other details. Now a student, by checking his leave history can know the status of the leave approval. This is how the project works.
